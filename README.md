# Cryptocurrency-Portfolio-Optimization
This study analyzes the construction of optimal cryptocurrency portfolios using three Modern-Portfolio-Theory-based optimization strategies for investors holding cryptocurrency portfolios following the cryptocurrency crash in 2018. Using simulation and modeling of maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio, minimum variance portfolio, and Markowitz portfolio, we found there is no big difference between the first two portfolios in terms of returns and variance, while Markowitz portfolio is not helpful for long-term investment. Furthermore, we applied Markowitz to each of the four phases of Wyckoffâ€™s market cycle for Bitcoin and the empirical result shows that the high-volatility feature of cryptocurrencies makes it more suitable for the four-phases approach of Markowitz and the portfolio return in each phase outperforms the classic Markowitz portfolio.
